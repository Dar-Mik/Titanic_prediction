# Titanic_prediction

My first project on a journey of becoming ML expert.

## PROGRESS TACKER
Here I track my progress and insights

# Day 1 - (7.7.2025)
I managed to copy the data from Kaggle. The import function was created in secondary folder in order to try importing functions from other folders. Then I downloaded and imported data into main file. I use Jupyter Notebook due to its accessibility and visual appeal.

I conducted the first part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focusing on Age, Sex, Class with respsect to Surivovrship. The data suggest that there is probably no significant difference in age when it comes to survivorship. However, there is significant difference in attributes of Sex and Class. People from higher class and females were prone to surviving. The differences are quite significant. 

Next steps:
1. Porceed with EDA focusing on remaining categories such as no. of family members on the ship
2. Creation of Binary dependent model

Main insights:
1. Need to work on my matplotlib skills - graphing
